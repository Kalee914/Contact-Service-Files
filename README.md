•	How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?<br>
<br>
I ensure my code, program, or software is functional and secure by planning testing use cases as soon as requirements documents are available. The earlier the testing begins, the earlier to identify issues and fix them before the errors/defects are embedded into the program. It is important to avoid errors and defects to carry over to the next stage; therefore, elimination and repair must start as early as possible. <br>

•	How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?<br>
<br>
The users’ needs and requests are obtained during the requirement elicitation. The goal of requirement elicitation is to clarify the issue and understand the user’s needs from the customer’s input.  Therefore, I carefully reviewed all the requirement documents to get a clear understanding and see if any unrealistic and vague requests needed to be addressed. Then, utilize these documents as a task list while creating the program to ensure that my program aligns with the requirements. <br>

•	How do I approach designing software?<br>
<br>
As mentioned, carefully reviewing the requirement documents and utilizing these documents to create a plan before implementation is vital to a successful project. Therefore, I would start a plan after requirement analysis as my approach to designing the software. The plan includes breaking down requirements into small tasks, setting priorities, and highlights, identifying constraints occurrence (problem anticipation), and planning solutions. After the plan is put together, I will begin the program implementation and testing process. <br>
